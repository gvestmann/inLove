Assignment on CSS animation

[LIVE SITE](https://gvestmann.github.io/inLove/)

Inspired by recent discovery of Neumorphism, I decided to try my hands on that for this project. I created a "Coming soon ..." page for inLove, a subdivision of the authoritarian mega-corporation LoveStar, from Andri Sn√¶r Magnasson's book of the same name. The company calculates people to find their perfect love-match. If you haven't read it, I highly recommend it. Some ideas that seemed truly absurd in 2002 have I actually come to life in one way or the other today. But anyways ...

The site is built in plain HTML. It includes some Javascript, but it's only for displaying/hiding the pop-up. I've organized the CSS by elements, so every animation is nearby it's "user". I made two self-triggering animations: the main's section slide-down and a heartbeat. Two animations are triggered by the user: the button's smooth change of colors on hover, and the pop-up fade-in upon button click.
